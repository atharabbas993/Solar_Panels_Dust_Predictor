# Solar Panel Dust Predictor

## Project Overview

The **Solar Panel Dust Predictor** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting dust accumulation on solar panels. Dust accumulation can reduce generated power by up to 50%, making it critical to address. This project helps optimize cleaning schedules, enhance solar panel efficiency, and minimize maintenance costs.

## Features
- Predicts the amount of dust accumulation based on environmental and operational data.
- Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- Provides actionable insights for maintenance planning.

## Objective
To enhance the efficiency of solar panels by predicting dust accumulation and suggesting optimal cleaning intervals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:
Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hemanthsai7/solar-panel-dust-detection)

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from sensors and external APIs.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features, and perform feature engineering.
